Description: This package allows users to estimate the indirect effects of mediators, calculate the overall indirect effect of mediators, and facilitates the execution of high-dimensional mediation analysis. The HDMAX2 method includes unobserved confounding factors through a latent factor mixed model approach. It supports the use of exposures of various types and the consideration of both continuous and binary outcomes.
